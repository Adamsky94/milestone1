                                    Moving back to my hometown in Hungary I got employed by the French sports retailer Decathlon and I worked in it’s warehouse which was the regional distribution centre of goods. I started my E-Commerce
                                    career at the packaging section just so I can quickly get used to my new environment. As time went my shifts were rostered through the rest of our processes involving product sorting, labeling and
                                    manually loading delivery trucks while providing and signing for the appropriate documentation. I was able to quickly pick up all the different procedures for customer order fullfilments. I had to be
                                    familiar with the specific areas within the warehouse. After a while I got promoted to be in charge of the bicycle customer orders exclusively. I had to make sure that they are safely assembled either by
                                    myself or other colleagues to company standards, firmly packaged and that the orders got dispatched before the appropriate deadline to the correct addresses. During this time I got to known my fiancée.
                                    The reason I left the job was that we wanted to relocate to Ireland together.
